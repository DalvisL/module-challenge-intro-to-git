## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is software responsible for tracking interactions and changes within files/file systems.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is software responsible for tracking interactions and changes within files/file systems.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
We create branches to isolate the work from other branches so that they aren't affected by any of the changes.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
To show others changes you've made to your branch. 

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The "git checkout" command can be used.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git merge, merges forked work with each other; any changes made on either get saved onto one branch. Git fetch downloads a repo but leaves your work unaffected. git pull downloads repos but will execute git merge, which leaves your work merged with the downloaded repo. 

7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is what happens when multiple commits are changing the same thing; because they can't both be saved only one commit can be chosen to resolve the merge conflict.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
By manually editing the file in question and selecting the changes that get to make the merge.
